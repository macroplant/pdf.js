# PDF.js

PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) library that is built with HTML5.
Our goal is to create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for
parsing and rendering PDFs.

This is a pre-built version of the PDF.js source code. It is automatically
generated by the build scripts.

For usage with older browsers/environments, without support for modern features
such as e.g. `async`/`await`, `Promise`, and `ReadableStream`,
please refer to the `es5` folder.

See https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js for learning and contributing.

# Remove Annotations from render

This build provides the functionality to remove annotations from pdf page api rendering context through `render` function.  

```
pdfJsPage.render({
  canvasContext: context,
  viewport: pdfJsPage.getViewport(),
  annotationsNotRendered: [
  AnnotationType.HIGHLIGHT
  AnnotationType.TEXT
  {annotationType: AnnotationType.WIDGET, fieldType: 'Tx'}
  {annotationType: AnnotationType.WIDGET, fieldType: 'Btn', checkBox: true}
  {annotationType: AnnotationType.WIDGET, fieldType: 'Btn', radioButton: true}
  {annotationType: AnnotationType.WIDGET, fieldType: 'Ch'}
]})
```
